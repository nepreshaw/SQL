--Chapter 8 Exercise 1
--Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns based on the --InvoiceTotal column of the Invoices table: • --Use the CAST function to return the first column as data type decimal with 2 digits to the right of the decimal point.--• Use CAST to return the second column as a varchar.--• Use the CONVERT function to return the third column as the same data type as the first column.--• Use CONVERT to return the fourth column as a varchar, using style 1.SELECT 	CAST(InvoiceTotal AS decimal (15,2)) AS decimalInvoiceTotal,	CAST(InvoiceTotal AS varchar) AS varcharInvoiceTotal,	CONVERT(decimal(15,2), InvoiceTotal) AS convertdecimal,	CONVERT(varchar, InvoiceTotal, 1) AS convertvarcharinvoicetotalFROM Invoices--Chapter 8 Exercise 2--Write a SELECT statement that returns three columns --based on the InvoiceDate column of the Invoices table: --• Use the CAST function to return the first column as data type varchar.--• Use the CONVERT function to return the second and third columns as a varchar, --using style 1 and style 10, respectively.SELECT	CAST(InvoiceDate AS varchar) AS castInvoiceDatevarchar,	CONVERT(varchar, InvoiceDate, 1) AS convertInvoiceDatevarchar1,	CONVERT(varchar, InvoiceDate, 10) AS convertInvoiceDatevarchar10FROM Invoices
